    <h1>Composite Availability Target Estimator</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
- This tool assists in calculating an estimated composite availability target 
    for a given set of critical flows through an application workload.
- The calculated estimate is intended to be used as a <b>rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM)   
    estimate for the general availability</b> of a workload based on the design and dependency 
    chain of each critical flow.
- While the calculated estimate is based on Microsoft published Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
    for individual cloud services. 

    <h2>This composite estimate does not represent a financially backed SLA guarantee and
    not eligible for Service Credits.</h2>

- Individual service SLAs are summarized on the SLA worksheet tab for easy reference.  
    Full SLA definitions can be referenced at the this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1">LINK</a>


Usage:
1. Start with an understanding of the critical application flow and the dependencies on Azure services for a flow within a workload in Azure.
2. In each grouping of services, use the dropdown list to select the cloud services used for that step in the critical application flow.
4. At the bottom of each group, select the flags based on how these services are deployed and leveraged in the critical application flow.
 4a. Zonal Deployment: Select "No" for deployments not explicitly pinned to one or more Zones, or # of Zones for zonal deployments that are explicitly pinned to one or more Zones.
 4b. AND/OR Grouping: If all services must be available in that group, select AND.  If only one of the services must be available, select OR.
 4c. If group is deployed to multiple Azure regions, select YES.  If using Active / Passive BCDR approach across multiple regions, note that RTO must be achievable within the "Projected Downtime" to attribute to an improved availability target.



 - Some services have multiple SLA option for non-zonal, zonal, zone redundant and multi-region deployments.
  If one of these exist, choose that option and do not set the "Zonal" flag to 1, 2 or 3 zones for these as the availability for these resources are 
  accounted for with the different SLA categories.
